Run scripts from your Midi device.


## Video

A somewhat outdated video of me using a previous version is available on YouTube:

## Why?

I use this for all kinds of reasons.

* A convenient way to trigger system functions during a music performance.
* A test-case launcher during software development so that you don't need to change windows to trigger a curl script, or something along those lines.
* A ghetto sampler - triggering sounds with `afplay` or "vocals" with the `say` command.

More to the point, if you already have a Midi device sitting on your desk unused, why not use it for something?


## How?

You can start ScriptMidi with the `scriptmidi` command.

This will expect

1. A number indicating which midi-device you wish to use
2. Pairs of input, indicating which note, and what command
3. Lines starting with a # are ignored

The note can be indicated with either the note-number on STDIN, or by playing
the note itself on the MIDI device.

All input can optionally be written to a log-file simply by redirecting STDOUT.
This allows you to play back a session in case you wish to reuse the bindings
you created.

In order to replay a session you just redirect STDIN into `scriptmidi`.

If you wish to be able to play-back a session, but also keep using the device
after the commands are read, you will need to enlist the help of your shell.

For example:

		(cat history.txt ; cat) | scriptmidi

Instructions in information is sent through the user to STDERR.
These instructional lines are always prefixed with `#`, so that
if you wish to capture this in a log you can simply redirect STDERR to STDOUT
like so:

		scriptmidi 2>&1 | tee log.txt

## Known Bugs

Have to enter "exit" twice if you begin by reading a log, and then STDIN and wish to exit immediately.
